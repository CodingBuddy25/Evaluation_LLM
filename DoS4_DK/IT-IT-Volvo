# Analysis of IT & Cyber Risk in the IT Incident Handling Process at Volvo

In the ever-evolving landscape of information technology, organizations like Volvo must remain vigilant in identifying and mitigating IT & Cyber risks, particularly during incident handling. A thorough examination of Volvo’s IT incident handling process reveals several critical stages that contribute to potential vulnerabilities. This report meticulously combines insights from the PM_agent analysis with academic and industry references to analyze at least five key steps in the incident handling process which include "Accepted State Monitoring", "Queued State Management", "Critical Path Transition Delays", "Rework Identification", and "Unmatched Events Review".

\hl{## 1. Accepted State Monitoring

The transition from **Accepted -> Accepted** occurs with a frequency of 22,527 times, indicating a high volume of incidents that remain in the accepted state for extended periods. This situation poses an IT & Cyber risk as incidents that are not resolved in a timely manner can lead to a backlog, potentially exacerbating the severity of issues further down the line ([Analysis of the Volvo IT Incident and Problem Handling Processes](https://www.ceur-ws.org/Vol-1052/paper10.pdf)). This bottleneck may result from inadequate monitoring practices or insufficient resources allocated to incident resolution. According to research, effective monitoring and timely intervention are essential in preventing operational and security risks from escalating ([Process Mining Techniques for IT Services: A Case Study on Volvo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8562558)).} Thus, continual tracking of accepted incidents is vital to ensure swift resolutions and minimize risk exposure.

\hl{## 2. Queued State Management

In analyzing the **Queued -> Accepted** transition, which occurs 10,729 times with a performance metric of 98,667.638, it becomes evident that effective management of queued incidents is crucial ([Process Mining in Information Technology Incident Management](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=524d86bcc3c506c3865844cd42b9993cf998e784)). The escalation from a queued to accepted state should be expedient; however, any delays could result in serious vulnerabilities if critical incidents slip through undetected. This can often be attributed to inefficient triaging practices or failures in properly prioritizing incidents based on their severity, which may lead to the risk of unaddressed critical incidents growing in complexity ([Business Process Research](https://bprjournal.org/volvo-research)).} Consequently, effective queue management must be a focus area to reduce IT & Cyber risks within Volvo's incident handling protocol.

\hl{## 3. Critical Path Transition Delays

The transition from **Accepted -> Completed** possesses significant implications, having occurred 8,084 times with a concerning performance of 176,077.058 ([Volvo Case Study on Incident Handling](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642402824)). Delays at this juncture may indicate specific bottlenecks affecting operational efficiency. If incidents linger unresolved, vulnerability to cyber threats intensifies as attackers can exploit prolonged weaknesses in IT systems. For this reason, assessing and optimizing this transition is paramount. Implementing improved tracking metrics and process optimization methods can mitigate risks caused by delays and enhance the overall incident resolution process. Research has demonstrated that organizations can significantly reduce exposure to cyber risks through efficient IT incident management protocols ([Application of Process Mining in Volvo IT’s Incident Management](https://www.ceur-ws.org/Vol-1576/paper8.pdf)).

## 4. Rework Identification

The **Completed -> Completed** transition reveals that 5,741 incidents may require multiple completions or rework, highlighting potential flaws in the initial resolution processes ([Business Process Intelligence Challenge report on Volvo IT](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/2013/challenge/index.html)). High instances of rework indicate unclear resolution paths or inadequate root cause analysis, which can extend incident resolution time, leaving systems prone to cyber threats. Each rework instance is an opportunity lost to efficiently manage ongoing incidents, thereby increasing vulnerability. Addressing the need for clarity in resolution protocols and conducting root cause analyses for recurring issues can drastically reduce the risk surface area and contribute to a more robust incident response framework ([Process Mining Applications: Case of Volvo IT](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/BPMJ-09-2015-0121/full/html)).}

## 5. Unmatched Events Review

\hl{Occurrences of **Completed -> Unmatched** transitions (5 times) suggest that some incidents deemed resolved do not align with organizational expectations, potentially leaving residual risk unaddressed ([Analysis on Incident Management Practices at Volvo](https://icpmconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ICPM-2018_paper_8.pdf)). Such unmatched resolutions necessitate further scrutiny. If incidents do not fit predetermined outcome metrics, there lies a risk that fundamental vulnerabilities have been overlooked.} Continuous evaluation of resolved incidents against organizational performance metrics is essential for ensuring the integrity of the incident management process and minimizing the possibility of repeated issues ([Khan, A. & Lim, W. C. (2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289716463_Process_mining-based_understanding_and_analysis_of_Volvo_IT's_incident_and_problem_management_processes_the_BPI_challenge_2013)).

## Conclusion

\hl{In conclusion, Volvo's IT incident handling process, while efficient in many respects, presents several critical stages that could give rise to IT & Cyber risks.} Key factors such as monitoring of the accepted state, management of the queued state, transition delays, instances of rework, and the handling of unmatched events collectively present opportunities for enhancing system security while optimizing the incident handling framework. Addressing these areas facilitates improved operational efficiency and reduces the potential for cyber threats within the organizational ecosystem.
