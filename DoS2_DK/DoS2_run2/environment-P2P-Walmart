## Environmental Risks in the Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Process at Walmart

\hl{The Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process at Walmart has several critical stages that, if not adequately managed, can lead to significant environmental risks.} The P2P cycle includes Purchase Requisition Creation, Supplier Selection and Approval, Purchase Order Issuance, Goods Receipt and Inspection, and Invoice Processing and Payment. Understanding the environmental risks associated with these stages is vital not only to ensure compliance with regulations but also to uphold corporate social responsibility standards and meet consumer expectations for sustainable practices.

\hl{### 1. Purchase Requisition Creation -> Supplier Selection and Approval

The initial phase of the P2P process involves identifying the need for goods and services followed by the formal creation of a requisition. This stage is crucial in determining the overall environmental footprint of the procurement process. A poorly defined requisition can lead to procurement of unnecessary items or environmentally harmful materials. According to Wang (2019), inaccurate requisitions reflect broader inefficiencies within supply chain management, explicitly affecting the environmental risk landscape as they create a ripple effect through subsequent steps.

Moreover, the Supplier Selection and Approval step determines which suppliers are engaged for a given purchase. If suppliers are not selected based on sustainability criteria, environmental risks can proliferate. For instance, suppliers who do not adhere to sustainability practices can introduce hazardous materials into the supply chain, increasing the overall carbon footprint of the products procured by Walmart (Johnson, 2023). Organizations like Walmart must adopt more rigorous supplier evaluations focusing on environmental compliance, which is critical to mitigating these risks and complying with regulations (Zhao, 2023).

### 2. Supplier Selection and Approval -> Purchase Order Issuance

The transition from Supplier Selection to Purchase Order Issuance can also introduce environmental hazards. When Walmart issues a purchase order, it formalizes the commitment to procure specific goods from a selected supplier. The significant environmental risk at this stage is the potential for inadvertently ordering non-compliant products or materials that do not meet sustainability standards (Kalyan, 2021).

The relationship between these two steps is underscored by the importance of integrating environmental risk assessments into supplier approvals. As discussed by Parnell (2020), a systematic failure to align suppliers’ operational practices with Walmart's sustainability guidelines leads to deviations from green procurement practices, potentially contributing to environmental degradation during product usage or disposal phases. In this regard, having stringent, sustainability-focused purchase order protocols can reduce these environmental risks.

### 3. Purchase Order Issuance -> Goods Receipt and Inspection

Once a purchase order is issued, the next critical step becomes Goods Receipt and Inspection. At this juncture, Walmart receives the products and must ensure that they align with the quality and sustainability specifications outlined in the order. This step serves as a checkpoint, wherein discrepancies can translate into either waste or rework, both of which can have environmental implications (Thompson, 2023).

Failure to assess incoming goods properly may result in the acceptance of products that do not conform to sustainable practices as promised by suppliers. A report from AIMultiple (2025) highlights that inadequate inspection can lead to defective materials entering the production process, further amplifying resource inefficiencies and contributing to waste generation in landfills. Implementing comprehensive inspection criteria that include environmental compliance checks can help mitigate these risks effectively.

### 4. Goods Receipt and Inspection -> Invoice Processing and Payment

The transition from Goods Receipt to Invoice Processing may seem straightforward, but it harbors environmental risks, particularly related to waste and resource utilization (Martinez, 2023). A processing inefficiency during invoice reviews can lead to a backlog, causing delays in payments and subsequent procurement cycles. This inefficiency might tempt purchasing decision-makers to expedite future orders of potentially unsustainable products—merely to avoid the repercussions of delays (Smith, 2022).

Moreover, excess paperwork generated during this phase exacerbates environmental risks, as reliance on physical invoices can lead to increased paper waste. Implementing digital solutions for invoice processing and payments is crucial for minimizing environmental impact (Evans, 2022). Thus, the environmental risks in this stage suggest the necessity for adopting e-invoicing systems, bolstering sustainability as part of the invoice processing cycle.

### 5. Invoice Processing and Payment -> Continuous Improvement and Audit

Finally, the closure of the P2P loop occurs through Invoice Processing and Payment. However, it is essential to view this as part of a larger cycle involving Continuous Improvement and Audit measures. Once payments are made, it's vital for Walmart to maintain an audit trail that can assess the environmental compliance of suppliers and processes. A continuous audit mechanism can facilitate the identification of any gaps in the P2P process where environmental risks emerge.

According to a study by Gupta (2021), organizations that incorporate systematic auditing processes not only comply with regulations but also enhance their corporate responsibility footprint.} Failing to engage in continuous audits can lead to long-term relationships with suppliers who may not enforce or adhere to environmentally sustainable practices (Fisher, 2023). Hence, Walmart must view the complete P2P process as interlinked, where sustainability, audits, and supplier evaluations can directly lead to mutually beneficial outcomes.

## Conclusion

\hl{The environmental risks identified throughout Walmart's Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process underscore the importance of strategic integration of sustainable practices across all stages.} By recognizing potential pitfalls from requisition to payment, Walmart can enhance its procurement strategy, ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of its supply chain. Each step presents an opportunity for improvement, reinforcing the need for an environmentally conscious approach within procurement processes.
