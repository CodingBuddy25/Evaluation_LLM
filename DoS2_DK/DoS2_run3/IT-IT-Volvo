### Identification of IT & Cyber Risks in the IT Incident Handling Process at Volvo

**Introduction**
The seamless operation of IT incident handling processes is vital for any modern organization. With the ever-increasing complexities of IT environments and potential cyber threats, understanding the risks within these systems is crucial, especially for a large automotive manufacturer like Volvo. \hl{This report aims to explore the IT and cyber risks present in Volvo’s IT incident handling process, leveraging insights from the Process Mining Agent (PM_agent) and analyzing those in the context of various stages within the incident handling workflow.} The central inquiry examines what these risks are and potential causes stemming from the documented processes, ensuring that each examined aspect links back to specific procedural steps. Notably, we will analyze at least five key steps from the PM_agent's findings, establishing a thorough understanding of each.

\hl{**1. Accepted Events -> Queued Events**
The transition from Accepted Events to Queued Events is an initial and critical phase within Volvo's incident management process. This step identifies how effectively incidents are accepted into the system. However, a bottleneck may occur at the Queued Events stage if there is an accumulation of incidents awaiting processing. A significant volume of queued incidents can signal inefficiencies within the workflow indicative of either inadequate response capabilities or overload of the system, both of which can introduce IT and cyber risks. Specifically, prolonged delays may leave unresolved issues, allowing for vulnerabilities to be exploited by cyber threats (source [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437773/)). This underscores the need for continuous monitoring and enhancing of throughput in the incident handling workflow.

**2. Queued Events -> Completed Events**
Completion rates serve as a key performance metric in assessing the efficiency of incident management procedures. As incidents progress from Queued Events to Completed Events, this transition highlights the fundamental performance of the incident handling system. Extended timeframes in reaching completion signify possible inadequacies in incident resolution procedures, potentially amplifying customer dissatisfaction and operational disruptions. These inefficiencies often arise from poor communication or procedural misalignments within teams, resulting in increased exposure to IT risks and even significant financial losses (source [2](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/streamlining-the-order-to-cash-process.pdf)).} Thus, regular audits and process improvements should aim to reduce these timeframes to ensure a robust incident management process.

\hl{**3. Completed Events -> Unmatched Events**
The correlation between Completed Events and Unmatched Events exemplifies the intricacies involved in resolving IT incidents. An elevated number of Unmatched Events indicates failures to address certain inputs or errors in processing incidents correctly. When incidents are not reconciled appropriately, the probability of recurring issues increases, creating a cycle of inefficiencies that compound risks (source [3](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/a-practical-approach-to-supply-chain-risk-management)).} This pattern can also lead to lost data or corrupted information, which are alarming risks in today's data-driven environment. \hl{Companies like Volvo should robustly track these metrics to minimize unmatched incidences through rigorous verification processes and staff training, ensuring quality assurance is maintained throughout the system.}

\hl{**4. Unmatched Events -> Loops and Rework**
The presence of Unmatched Events often leads to Loops and Rework, signifying a need for repeated processing cycles to manage the residual issues stemming from prior incident handling attempts. Each cycle of rework not only adds to operational costs but directly affects system efficiency (source [4](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/cpg-operations-how-to-win-in-a-rapidly-changing-environment)).} Furthermore, frequent loops can frustrate employees and drain valuable resources, leading to broader implications on employee morale and productivity. Companies like Volvo need to invest in continuous process improvement initiatives to address the inefficiencies inherent in the handling of unmatched incidents.

\hl{**5. Loops and Rework -> Prevention Strategies**
Establishing effective prevention strategies is a vital component in mitigating risks that arise due to repetitive rework cycles and inefficiencies.} The risk of burnout among employees, coupled with increased response times to incidents, can harm Volvo’s reputation amongst stakeholders. By implementing solid prevention mechanisms—such as leveraging automation tools, revising training programs, and reinforcing communication—Volvo can significantly diminish the occurrences of loops while enhancing the resilience of their incident management process (source [5](https://www.academia.edu/126261049/Volvo_Incident_and_Problem_Management_Behavior_Analysis)). The goal is to create a proactive environment where potential IT risks are identified and addressed before they escalate into significant issues.

### Conclusion
\hl{Understanding the interplay between the stages of incident handling, notably with a focus on the risks presented at each step, is essential for any organization, especially for an industry leader such as Volvo.} Through rigorous process analysis and implementation of improvement strategies, Volvo can enhance its incident management operations while minimizing associated IT and cyber risks. Each step in this workflow—from Accepted Events through to prevention strategies—indicates potential areas for both vulnerability and improvement. Ongoing attention and investment in these processes will not only fortify Volvo’s IT infrastructure but also ensure sustained operational resilience.
