\hl{# Optimizing Accounts Payable at General Electric: A Process Mining Perspective}

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving business landscape of 2025, Accounts Payable (AP) has transcended its traditional role as a back-office function to become a strategic lever for cost control, risk management, and operational efficiency. \hl{For multinational corporations like General Electric (GE), optimizing AP processes is crucial to maintaining competitive advantage.} This report synthesizes insights from process mining, industry benchmarks, and case studies to provide a comprehensive analysis of AP inefficiencies at GE and actionable strategies for improvement. The report draws on over 20 authoritative sources and integrates findings from process mining diagnostics to highlight key areas for optimization.

\hl{## The Strategic Importance of Accounts Payable

Accounts Payable is a critical financial function that directly influences cash flow, supplier relationships, and overall profitability. For GE, a global conglomerate with complex supply chains and financial operations, AP inefficiencies can lead to significant financial leakage, compliance risks, and operational bottlenecks ([MHC Automation, 2025](https://www.mhcautomation.com/blog/accounts-payable-trends/)). The complexity of GE’s operations—spanning multiple business units, currencies, and regulatory environments—amplifies the impact of process inefficiencies. The 'Receive Invoice -> Digitize Invoice' step, with a high performance time, exemplifies potential bottlenecks in GE's AP processes, possibly due to inefficient digitization methods or handling large volumes manually.

## Common Process Inefficiencies in AP

### Manual Data Entry and Paper-Based Processes

Despite advances in automation, many organizations still rely on manual invoice entry and paper-based workflows. According to recent statistics, 68% of companies manually key invoices into their ERP systems, with the average cost of processing a manual invoice reaching $15 ([DocuClipper, 2025](https://www.docuclipper.com/blog/accounts-payable-statistics/)). For a company the size of GE, processing millions of invoices annually, these costs quickly escalate. The 'Digitize Invoice -> Approve Invoice' step, with significant delays, indicates inefficiencies in verification or the need for further manual review.

### Lack of End-to-End Automation

Only about 10% of organizations have achieved full end-to-end automation in AP ([MHC Automation, 2025](https://www.mhcautomation.com/blog/accounts-payable-trends/)). Manual interventions are still required for approvals, exception handling, and data validation, leading to delays and increased error rates. The 'Prepare Payment -> Initiate Payment' step, with long performance times, suggests delays in transitioning from preparation to initiation, potentially due to approvals or system issues.

### Limited Visibility and Siloed Information

A lack of real-time visibility into invoice status, liabilities, and cash flow is a persistent challenge. Siloed systems and decentralized AP functions—common in large conglomerates like GE—further exacerbate this issue, making it difficult to track outstanding payments and manage working capital effectively ([Naviant, 2025](https://naviant.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP-Automation-Global-Manufacturer.pdf)). The 'Payment Confirmed -> Receive Invoice' step, indicating rework loops, suggests issues in the initial stages of invoice verification or matching.

### High Exception Rates

Invoice exceptions—due to mismatches, missing data, or compliance issues—are a major source of inefficiency. Organizations adopting advanced automation have seen a 40% reduction in invoice exceptions ([PLANERGY, 2025](https://planergy.com/blog/accounts-payable-in-2025/)), but many still struggle with exception management. The 'Match Invoice -> Approve Invoice' step, with large performance times, implies potential inefficiencies due to additional checks or system mismatches requiring manual interventions.}

### Delayed Approvals and Missed Discounts

\hl{Manual processes often lead to delayed invoice approvals, resulting in missed early-payment discounts and strained supplier relationships. Automated AP departments capture early-payment discounts 35% more frequently than their manual counterparts ([PLANERGY, 2025](https://planergy.com/blog/accounts-payable-in-2025/)).

## Quantifying the Impact: Case Study and Industry Benchmarks

A Fortune 100 manufacturer, comparable in scale to GE, processed over 1.25 million invoices annually from 8,000+ vendors in a manual AP environment. After automating their AP processes, they realized an ROI in less than a year and saved $1.5 million in the first year ([Naviant, 2025](https://naviant.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP-Automation-Global-Manufacturer.pdf)). For GE, similar inefficiencies would translate into millions of dollars in avoidable costs, lost discounts, and increased risk exposure.}

## Key Metrics for Identifying and Addressing AP Inefficiencies

Tracking the right metrics is essential for diagnosing and remediating AP process inefficiencies. Industry leaders recommend monitoring:

- **Cost per Invoice**: Total AP processing cost divided by the number of invoices.
- **Invoice Processing Time**: Average days to process an invoice.
- **Exception Rate**: Percentage of invoices requiring manual intervention.
- **Early Payment Discount Capture**: Percentage of available discounts realized.
- **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)**: Average time to pay suppliers.
- **Touchless Processing Rate**: Percentage of invoices processed without human touch.
