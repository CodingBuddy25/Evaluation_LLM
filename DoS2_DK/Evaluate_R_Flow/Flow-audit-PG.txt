## Introduction

Procter & Gamble (P&G), a global leader in the consumer goods industry, operates within a complex and expansive operational framework. \hl{The Order-to-Cash (O2C) process is a critical component of P&G's operations}, directly impacting financial performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This report explores the intersection of P&G's O2C process, process mining, and audit risks, providing a comprehensive analysis of how these elements interact and influence each other. The analysis draws on over 20 authoritative sources, prioritizing recent, relevant, and reliable information to deliver a comprehensive perspective.

## 1. Overview of the Order-to-Cash (O2C) Process

The O2C process encompasses all steps from customer order placement through to the receipt and application of payment. For a multinational like P&G, this process is multifaceted, involving numerous touchpoints, stakeholders, and systems across global markets ([HogoNext, 2024](https://hogonext.com/how-to-conduct-a-comprehensive-order-to-cash-audit/)). The main stages include:

- **Customer onboarding and credit assessment**
- **Order management and fulfillment**
- **Invoicing and billing**
- **Payment collection and cash application**
- **Dispute management and customer service**

Each stage presents unique operational and audit risks, especially given P&G’s scale, product diversity, and geographic reach ([HighRadius, 2024](https://www.highradius.com/resources/Blog/order-to-cash-process-optimization/)).

\hl{### Process Mining Step: Order Validation -> Order Validation

The 'Order Validation -> Order Validation' step highlights potential inefficiencies or issues in the validation criteria. Multiple validations might indicate incomplete or erroneous data that could lead to incorrect order processing, increasing the risk of revenue loss or customer dissatisfaction ([Process_mining_agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437773/)).

## 2. Key Audit Risks in the O2C Cycle

### 2.1. Sales Order Processing

**Risks:**  
- Errors or delays in processing can result in incorrect shipments or invoicing.
- Inadequate documentation or controls may lead to revenue leakage or fraud ([LinkedIn, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/order-cash-o2c-process-overview-key-risks-audit-muhammad-saad)).

**P&G Context:**  
Given the company’s high transaction volumes and product variety, even minor process lapses can have significant financial impacts.

### Process Mining Step: Customer Credit Check -> Customer Credit Check

A repetitive credit check indicates potential issues with customer credit evaluation. This may cause delays in order processing and risk accepting orders from customers with insufficient credit limits, leading to potential financial exposure ([Process_mining_agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437773/)).}

### 2.2. Credit Risk Management

**Risks:**  
- Extending credit to customers with poor creditworthiness increases the risk of bad debts.
