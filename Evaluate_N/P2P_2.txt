## Environmental and Sustainability Risks in Retail Returns Management

The retail industry, exemplified by giants such as Walmart, is facing a critical juncture where the sustainability of its operations is under intense scrutiny. \hl{The 'Receive Goods -\> Verify Goods Returned' step in the purchase to pay process is a significant contributor to environmental and sustainability risks.} This stage, often overlooked, involves the handling of returned goods, which has become a substantial part of retail operations, especially with the rise of e-commerce.

\hl{Recent studies have highlighted the profound impact that returns have on the environment. In the United States alone, returned items generate approximately [16 million metric tons of carbon emissions](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/39601-returns-and-sustainability-a-report) annually during their reverse journey, and contribute to 9.5 billion pounds of landfill waste}. This staggering figure underscores the need for a sustainable approach to managing returns. \hl{ The environmental footprint of returns is exacerbated by the inefficiencies in traditional reverse logistics, with e-commerce returns producing up to [14\% more landfill waste](https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/digital-commerce/how-returns-drag-down-sustainability-efforts-and-what-retailers-can-do-about-it) than those from brick-and-mortar stores.}

Walmart, as a leader in the retail sector, has recognized the importance of addressing these challenges. \hl{The company has been actively engaging suppliers and customers in sustainability efforts, as evidenced by their [supplier scorecards](https://sustainabilityconsortium.org/walmart-tried-to-make-sustainability-affordable-heres-what-happened/) and investments in sustainable supply chain enhancements.} However, the complexity of global supply chains and the systemic nature of these issues mean that lasting improvement requires collaboration among many stakeholders, as Walmart's approach suggests ([Walmart's ESG Report](https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/esgreport/environmental/product-supply-chain-sustainability)).

\hl{The retail industry's commitment to sustainability is also reflected in the allocation of significant budgets towards enhancing reverse supply chains, with a notable proportion of respondents investing in sustainable initiatives ([Supply Chain Brain Report](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/39601-returns-and-sustainability-a-report)). Moreover, the trend towards reducing or eliminating fees for online returns indicates a shift towards encouraging more environmentally friendly in-store returns ([Supply Chain Brain Report](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/39601-returns-and-sustainability-a-report)).}

As we delve deeper into the environmental and sustainability risks associated with the 'Receive Goods -\> Verify Goods Returned' step in the purchase to pay process, it is imperative to consider the full scope of these challenges and the innovative solutions being implemented by retail leaders like Walmart. This introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of the current state of retail returns, the associated risks, and the strategies being employed to mitigate their impact on the environment.

# Environmental and Sustainability Challenges of Retail Returns

## Impact of Returns on Resource Consumption and Waste Generation

The retail industry, particularly large organizations like Walmart, faces significant environmental challenges due to the high volume of product returns. \hl{The National Retail Federation estimates that approximately 16.5\% of all items sold are returned, with this number rising above 50\% for online sales in certain segments like apparel ([Return Logic](https://www.returnlogic.com/blog/how-returns-impact-the-profitability-and-sustainability-of-retail-businesses/)). These returns lead to additional consumption of raw materials and energy for production, packaging, and transportation. Moreover, returned items often end up in landfills if they cannot be resold, contributing to waste generation and associated environmental impacts.}

## Carbon Footprint of Reverse Logistics

The process of returning goods involves reverse logistics, which can significantly increase the carbon footprint of retail operations. \hl{Shipping returned items back to distribution centers or manufacturers requires additional transportation, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, in 2022, Target reported nearly 6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from transporting goods from distribution centers to consumers,} and this figure more than doubled when including emissions from suppliers shipping goods to Target's network ([UPI](https://www.upi.com/Voices/2024/04/25/big-box-retailers-pollution/1421714050438/)).

## Water and Air Pollution from Increased Transportation

The increased transportation required for handling returns not only contributes to greenhouse gas emissions but also to air and water pollution. \hl{Diesel-fueled trucks used for transporting returned goods can lead to air emissions that affect local air quality, particularly in urban areas where retail supply chain infrastructure is expanding }([UPI](https://www.upi.com/Voices/2024/04/25/big-box-retailers-pollution/1421714050438/)). \hl{Additionally, the runoff from large parking lots at distribution centers can pose threats to local waterways, affecting both water quality and aquatic ecosystems.}

## Mitigation Strategies: 'Keep It' Policies and Sustainable Reverse Supply Chains

\hl{To mitigate the environmental impact of returns, some retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, have adopted 'keep it' policies, where customers are encouraged to keep unwanted items instead of returning them ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/claraludmir/2023/12/05/the-billion-dollar-return-nightmare-why-retailers-are-enabling-keep-it-policies/)). While this approach reduces the immediate need for reverse logistics, it is not a long-term solution and could lead to potential abuse of the policy. Sustainable reverse supply chains are another strategy, focusing on reducing the environmental impact of returns through better management systems and practices ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-15066-2\_9)).}

## Role of Technology and Innovation in Reducing Environmental Impact

Technology and innovation play a crucial role in addressing the environmental challenges of retail returns. \hl{ By implementing advanced data analytics, retailers can better forecast returns and manage inventory, thus reducing excess production and waste. Additionally, investing in more sustainable packaging and transportation methods can help lower the carbon footprint associated with returns. Walmart's Project Gigaton initiative is an example of a collaborative effort to reduce emissions across the supply chain, including the reverse logistics process ([Walmart Corporate](https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/sustainability/planet/climate-change)).}

In summary, the 'Receive Goods -\> Verify Goods Returned' step in the purchase to pay process presents several environmental and sustainability risks for large retail organizations like Walmart. \hl{These include increased resource consumption, waste generation, carbon emissions, and pollution from transportation. Mitigation strategies such as 'keep it' policies, sustainable reverse supply chains, and the use of technology can help reduce these impacts. However, a comprehensive approach involving collaboration with suppliers, innovation, and customer engagement is necessary to address these challenges effectively.}
