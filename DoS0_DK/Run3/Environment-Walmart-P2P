## Environmental Risks in the Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Process at Walmart: Analysis and Causes

\hl{Walmart, as a leading global retailer, follows a structured Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process that encompasses various stages, each presenting unique opportunities and challenges. This report aims to explore the environmental risks associated with Walmart’s P2P process, identify the potential causes of these risks,} and discuss the strategies implemented to mitigate these environmental impacts. The examination of the P2P process will directly refer to the steps provided by the PM_agent, linking practical activities to identified environmental risks.

### Key Stages of the P2P Process that Contribute to Environmental Risks

The P2P process at Walmart comprises several critical stages, including requisition delivery, supplier selection, receipt of goods, invoice processing, and payment. Each of these stages contains inherent environmental risks. \hl{For instance, in the first step, **Send Purchase Order -> Receive Goods**, the risk of excessive carbon emissions from transportation becomes evident. When Walmart places orders with suppliers, the logistics involved in transporting these goods can lead to significant greenhouse gas emissions if inefficiencies are present (González-Rivero, J., et al., 2022). The reliance on fossil fuel-powered transportation options exacerbates this issue, making it essential for Walmart to employ vendors who prioritize sustainability in their logistics practices ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437773/)).

Furthermore, vendors’ environmental compliance practices during the **Receive Goods -> Inspect Goods** transition can contribute to additional risks. If suppliers do not adhere to sustainable practices, the consequent waste generation related to excessive packaging poses another substantial risk ([Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/streamlining-the-order-to-cash-process.pdf)).} Importantly, the process of receiving and inspecting goods must incorporate environmentally friendly practices, minimizing waste, and opting for recyclable materials to mitigate potential risks to the environment.

### Environmental Risks Associated with Each Stage of P2P

\hl{In examining each stage of the P2P process at Walmart, various specific environmental risks are identifiable:

1. **Requisition Delivery**: Environmental risks begin with vendor selection. Suppliers using outdated or unsustainable manufacturing processes can considerably increase carbon footprints associated with P2P. When Walmart issues a purchase order, it’s pivotal to consider the sustainability initiatives and emissions data of the chosen vendor ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/a-practical-approach-to-supply-chain-risk-management)).

2. **Goods Reception**: Once the goods are received, risks shift to handling excessive waste from packaging materials, which poses disposal challenges and contributes to landfill overload ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/cpg-operations-how-to-win-in-a-rapidly-changing-environment)). Sustainable retrieval processes should be implemented to reduce environmental impact.

3. **Invoice Processing**: The invoice processing stage may appear administrative; however, it indirectly influences environmental risks through paper consumption and electronic waste related to the technologies utilized ([Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/streamlining-the-order-to-cash-process.pdf)). Adopting an e-invoicing system that reduces paper use can minimize such risks.

4. **Payment**: Payment processes can also entail environmental impacts, particularly through the energy consumption associated with the IT systems that manage these transactions. Transitioning to more energy-efficient systems can decrease the carbon footprint related to payment processing ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437773/)).

5. **Supplier Feedback**: Lastly, the approach to engaging suppliers for performance feedback after the payment initiative occurs can affect long-term environmental strategies. If Walmart collaborates with suppliers on sustainability initiatives, this can foster continual improvement and reduce environmental risks ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/a-practical-approach-to-supply-chain-risk-management)).}

### Causes of Environmental Risks Identified in the P2P Process

Identifying causes of environmental risks inherent within the P2P process at Walmart unveils several underlying factors. One major contributor is the complexity of the global supply chain. Various suppliers across diverse geographical locations may not engage equally in sustainability practices ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/cpg-operations-how-to-win-in-a-rapidly-changing-environment)). This inconsistency can lead to significant variations in environmental performance across product lines.

\hl{Another potential cause lies in the consumer demand for low-cost products. To sustain competitive pricing, suppliers might compromise on sustainable practices, thus creating a detrimental cycle where price competition undermines environmental responsibility ([Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/streamlining-the-order-to-cash-process.pdf)). Walmart must ensure that cost-cutting measures do not sacrifice sustainability initiatives.

Compliance failures present another cause of environmental risk. If suppliers fail to comply with the existing environmental regulations, it could instigate legal repercussions for Walmart as well ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437773/)). Regular audits of supplier compliance and alignment with environmental standards are essential to mitigate these risks.

Transportation methods also play a pivotal role. Choosing suppliers without efficient logistics can lead to increased emissions, which in turn feeds into climate change. Walmart must analyze transportation routes and modes, favoring local suppliers or environmentally-friendly transport practices ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/a-practical-approach-to-supply-chain-risk-management)).}

### Current Strategies by Walmart to Mitigate Environmental Risks

Walmart has implemented various initiatives aimed at minimizing environmental risks throughout its P2P process. One significant strategy is developing the Sustainability Index to assess and promote supplier engagement in environmentally responsible practices ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437773/)). This index allows Walmart to evaluate supplier performance continually, fostering a culture of sustainability across its supply chain.

Walmart has also emphasized reducing packaging waste as a cornerstone of its environmental strategy. By encouraging suppliers to adopt sustainable packaging practices, the company is proactively addressing waste generation challenges associated with the P2P process ([Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/streamlining-the-order-to-cash-process.pdf)). Furthermore, initiatives to train suppliers and promote the use of recyclable materials can enhance waste management strategies.

Additionally, Walmart has made strides in energy-efficient technological upgrades in its payment and invoice processing systems. By focusing on reducing energy consumption within its IT infrastructure, the company aligns its operations with best practices in sustainability ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/a-practical-approach-to-supply-chain-risk-management)).

Finally, consumer engagement has been integral to Walmart's sustainability campaigns. Increased transparency regarding its supply chain practices informs consumers about Walmart's commitment to sustainability, allowing them to make informed choices ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/cpg-operations-how-to-win-in-a-rapidly-changing-environment)). This engagement not only elevates consumer awareness but reinforces Walmart’s position as a leader in sustainable retailing.
