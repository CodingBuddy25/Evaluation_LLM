Environmental risks in the purchase-to-pay (P2P) process at Walmart are multifaceted and arise from various stages throughout the procurement cycle. Below we will examine these risks in detail, referencing specific steps from the PM_agent, the PM diagnostic task, and relevant literature sources.

\hl{### 1. Procurement Stage Analysis: Create Purchase Requisition

The initial phase of the P2P process, 'Create Purchase Requisition', primarily sets the tone for the entire procurement strategy. ***Walmart's focus on cost and efficiency can lead to the selection of suppliers that may not adhere to sustainable practices***. Overlooking environmental criteria when requisitioning goods can result in sourcing from companies that contribute negatively to climate change and biodiversity loss (Ahi & Searcy, 2013). *As highlighted in the PM_agent, the procurement stage must evaluate suppliers based on sustainability metrics*, similar to the recommendations provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), to ensure responsible sourcing is prioritized (Global Reporting Initiative, 2020).

Thus, the potential cause of environmental risks during the requisition phase often stems from insufficient evaluation processes that overlook sustainability, leading to higher emissions and unsustainable practices. Failure to integrate thorough supplier assessments contributes to environmental degradation associated with Walmart's supply chain (Carter & Rogers, 2008).

### 2. Supplier Selection and Approval: Approve Purchase Requisition

Following the creation of a purchase requisition is the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' stage. ***It is crucial that the approval process integrates an environmental review of proposed suppliers*** (Gunasekaran et al., 2015). If management prioritizes cost over environmental standards at this stage, it may endorse suppliers who employ unsustainable methods, which directly contributes to environmental risks such as deforestation and overexploitation of resources.

As the PM_agent analysis indicates, a lack of transparency in supplier practices during the approval process can further exacerbate these risks. Failure to validate suppliers' commitments to sustainability can lead to Wal-Mart's associations with companies engaging in harmful environmental practices, undermining the corporation's overall ethical commitments (Linton et al., 2007).

### 3. Order Processing and Sustainability: Create Purchase Order

The 'Create Purchase Order' step in the P2P process has environmental implications due to the choices made during order processing. ***Sustainable procurement practices within Walmart can be hampered by inadequate systems for tracking and verifying supplier compliance*** with agreed-upon sustainability metrics. For instance, if orders are placed without consideration of how products are transported or produced, it can lead to increased carbon footprints through inefficient logistics chains (Bai & Sarkis, 2010).

As referenced in the PM_agent, lack of streamlined data integration and supplier monitoring can lead to higher resource consumption, such as packaging materials and transportation energy (Pagell & Wu, 2009). Thus, the underlying causes of these environmental risks include ineffective coordination of supplier actions and inadequate visibility of supply chain practices, which are crucial in maintaining sustainable operations.

### 4. Transportation Emissions and Logistics: Send Purchase Order

The next stage, 'Send Purchase Order', involves logistics and distribution, which are foundational to evaluating environmental risks (McKinnon, 2010). ***Walmart's extensive distribution network contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions through the transportation of goods***. Issues arise when logistical decisions do not account for sustainability, such as optimizing routes or consolidating shipments.}

The PM_agent emphasizes the need for effective logistics management to reduce these environmental risks. Actions like adopting alternative fuel vehicles or implementing cross-docking can mitigate transportation-related emissions (Taticchi et al., 2013). If these measures are not applied, Walmart can perpetuate significant environmental detriment, exemplifying a failure to address logistics as a critical component of sustainability in their P2P framework.

### 5. Compliance and Audit Process: Validate Invoice

Lastly, the 'Validate Invoice' phase is essential for ensuring that the inputs received align with sustainability contracts. ***Failure to audit supplier practices during this phase can lead to continued partnerships with vendors who may not adhere to environmental regulations***. Without rigorous validation mechanisms, *the risk of engaging non-compliant suppliers persists*, potentially leading to fines and remediation actions that reflect poorly on corporate governance policies (Coyle et al., 2013).}

The insights from the PM_agent highlight a need for robust compliance programs that monitor supplier practices continually, ensuring accountability through the P2P cycle (Zhu & Geng, 2013). The lack of compliance mechanisms can expose Walmart to reputational and legal risks, thereby increasing its overall environmental footprint and challenges in meeting sustainability goals.

### Conclusion

\hl{In examining Walmart's purchase-to-pay process, various environmental risks emerge linked to each stage, significantly informed by supplier behavior, insufficient compliance mechanisms, and internal corporate policies.} The risks identified reveal a complex interplay of costs versus environmental stewardship, highlighting areas where Walmart can enhance their procurement practices to mitigate potential threats to sustainability.

Ultimately, addressing these environmental risks requires a holistic approach from the creation of purchase requisitions to the validation of invoices, emphasizing the importance of sustainability at each junction of the P2P process.

By identifying and analyzing these intricate connections, companies like Walmart can achieve not only improved compliance with environmental regulations but also create a more sustainable supply chain that aligns with their corporate values and stakeholder expectations.
