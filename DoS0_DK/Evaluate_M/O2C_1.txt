 \hl{## Authorization of Purchase Orders
Unauthorized purchase orders can lead to financial losses and non-compliance with company policies. It is crucial that all purchase orders at Procter \& Gamble are reviewed and authorized by appropriate personnel before being sent to suppliers. The risk is that unauthorized or fraudulent orders may be processed, leading to unnecessary expenditures or receipt of non-required goods.

 \hl{## Verification of Goods Received
Upon receipt of goods, there is a risk that the items may not match the purchase order in terms of quantity, quality, or specifications. Procter \& Gamble must have controls in place to verify that the goods received are as per the order. This includes checking the delivery against the purchase order and packing slip, and inspecting the goods for damage or defects. Failure to do so can result in inventory discrepancies, financial losses, and potential issues with product safety and compliance.

## Accurate Recording of Transactions
The accurate recording of purchase orders and the receipt of goods in the accounting system is essential to maintain reliable financial records. There is a risk of misstatement in financial reporting if the transactions are not recorded promptly and accurately. Procter \& Gamble must ensure that internal controls are in place for the proper recording of these transactions to prevent financial inaccuracies and maintain compliance with financial reporting standards.

 \hl{# Legal and Financial Risks in the 'Send Purchase Order -\> Receive Goods' Step}

\hl{## Legal Risks Associated with Purchase Orders and Goods Receipt} 

 \hl{### Contractual Obligations and Compliance
When Procter \& Gamble sends a purchase order to a supplier, it enters into a contractual agreement that binds both parties to specific terms and conditions. Failure to comply with these terms can lead to legal disputes, which may result in financial penalties or damage to business relationships. For instance, if goods received do not meet the contractual specifications, P\&G may face legal challenges in enforcing the contract or seeking remedies.} 

 \hl{### Intellectual Property Risks
In the consumer goods sector, intellectual property (IP) is a critical asset. P\&G must ensure that the goods received do not infringe on any third-party IP rights. Unintentional IP violations can lead to costly litigation and reputational harm. ([Procter \& Gamble Annual Report 2023](https://us.pg.com/annualreport2023/financial-highlights/))}

 \hl{### Regulatory Compliance
P\&G operates in a highly regulated environment. The company must ensure that all goods received comply with local and international regulations , such as safety standards, labeling requirements, and environmental laws. Non-compliance can result in fines, legal action, and a tarnished brand image.}

\hl{## Financial Risks Associated with Purchase Orders and Goods Receipt}

 \hl{### Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Given P\&G's global operations, purchase orders often involve transactions in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly impact the cost of goods received, leading to financial statement volatility. ([Decoding Procter \& Gamble Co (PG)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decoding-procter-gamble-co-pg-050421313.html)) }

 \hl{### Credit Risk}
\hl{When P\&G issues a purchase order, there is a risk that the supplier may default on delivery, especially in cases of prepayment. This credit risk can disrupt the supply chain and affect the company's operational efficiency and financial performance.} 

 \hl{### Price Fluctuation Risk}
\hl{The prices of raw materials and goods can be volatile, influenced by market conditions, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainties. P\&G must manage the risk of price increases between the time of sending a purchase order and receiving goods, which can affect gross margins and profitability. ([Decoding Procter \& Gamble Co (PG)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decoding-procter-gamble-co-pg-050421313.html)) }

\hl{### Inventory Valuation Risk}
\hl{Upon receipt of goods, P\&G must accurately record inventory at the correct valuation. Misstatements due to overvaluation or undervaluation of inventory can lead to financial reporting errors, impacting the company's financial health and investor confidence.}

### Legal and Regulatory Risk Management
P\&G must continuously monitor and manage legal and regulatory risks by implementing robust compliance programs and staying abreast of changes in laws and regulations. Failure to do so can lead to legal liabilities and financial losses. ([Legal and Regulatory Risk](https://www.financestrategists.com/wealth-management/investment-risk/legal-and-regulatory-risk/))
