\hl{## Environmental Risks in the Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) Process at Walmart

Walmart operates an intricate Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process that encompasses several stages including requisitioning, procurement, invoicing, and payment (Walmart Corporate, 2023; Green America, 2023). Each of these stages can potentially introduce environmental risks, underscoring the need for a thorough analysis. This report aims to identify specific environmental risks linked to Walmart's P2P process and the underlying causes of these risks, derived through a comprehensive review of environmental impacts across each P2P stage.}

\hl{### Requisitioning -> Vendor Selection}
The initial stage of requisitioning can significantly influence subsequent vendor selection, with inefficiencies leading to problematic purchasing behavior. \hl{Poorly defined requisitions may result in over-purchasing â€“ inflating inventory levels that contribute to increased waste (Capgemini, 2017).} This excess waste has environmental repercussions, particularly when it refers to goods that have limited shelf life or cannot be reused. \hl{Over-reliance on suppliers who do not adhere to sustainable practices can exacerbate these issues. For example, if high-demand goods are requisitioned without important sustainability criteria, it may encourage unsustainable extraction methods, contributing to resource depletion and habitat destruction (Mckinsey & Company, 2023)}. Continuous monitoring and enhancement of the requisitioning process can help alleviate these risks.

\hl{### Vendor Selection -> Order Creation
Once suppliers are selected, the following step in the P2P process is the creation of orders. This stage commonly utilizes paper-based purchase orders, contributing to high levels of deforestation and paper waste (Shenavar, 2023). Transitioning to electronic systems can significantly mitigate this risk. However, many organizations, including Walmart, still grapple with a steep learning curve regarding shifting to a fully digital process. Inefficient processes lead to delays, urging staff to print excessive orders (Emerger Strategies, 2023). Hence, Walmart needs to optimize and digitize its order creation to lessen paper waste and improve overall environmental outcomes.

### Order Creation -> Receive Goods
Receiving goods represents another potential environmental risk. If inspections are not thorough during the receiving process, defective products may be accepted and later discarded. This scenario increases waste and contributes to landfill overflow significantly, which is environmentally detrimental (Supply Chain Dive, 2023). Poorly defined quality control mechanisms can result in Walmart inadvertently supporting the cycle of waste generation.} Implementing rigorous inspection practices for incoming goods and creating a return policy more focused on sustainability could effectively combat these risks, aligning business operations with environmental goals.

\hl{### Receive Goods -> Payment Processing}
The payment processing step, while at first glance less directly connected to environmental impact, is inherently linked with product sustainability. \hl{Often, Walmart may unintentionally engage in payments for non-sustainable products, which can deplete vital resources (Walmart Corporate, 2023). When unsustainable products are purchased and prioritized for transactions, they inadvertently promote further environmental degradation through their lifecycle.} Strengthening supplier relationships and pushing for commitments towards sustainable product offerings can encourage better outcomes. Capitalizing on supplier contracts that focus on sustainable products would not only reduce environmental impacts but also bolster Walmart's reputation regarding sustainability practices.

\hl{### Payment Processing -> Supplier Management
Supplier management is critical to averting a range of environmental risks, including those linked to compliance with environmental regulations. As significant players in the retail market, Walmart must enforce strict oversight in ensuring suppliers meet sustainability standards (Snaplinc Consulting, n.d.). Weak compliance could lead to the continuation of harmful production methods and operations within Walmart's supply chain. Suppliers may engage in practices that violate environmental guidelines while focusing on lower costs or fast turnaround solutions, jeopardizing Walmart's environmental commitments (Mckinsey & Company, 2023).} Expanding compliance frameworks that include environmental audits and sustainable performance metrics can effectively foster a culture of sustainability within the supply chain.

\hl{### Addressing Specific Environmental Risks
Some specific environmental risks inherent in Walmart's P2P process include climate change implications due to high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics and transportation, which contribute significantly to Walmart's carbon footprint. Furthermore, issues of resource depletion and waste generation are pronounced, as Walmart's scale amplifies their collective effects. Other critical risks involve potential water pollution impacts resulting from inadequate waste disposal methods (Green America, 2023; Walmart Corporate, 2023).} Finally, concrete measures must be put in place to ensure that suppliers remain compliant with local and international environmental regulations, minimizing risks associated with market and reputational damages.

### Regulatory Compliance Challenges
Walmart's position in the marketplace requires adherence to strict regulatory and compliance factors linked with environmental sustainability within its P2P process. Key regulations include international standards such as ISO 14000, focusing on environmental management, as well as sustainability goals such as Project Gigaton, which aims to eliminate one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the company's global supply chain (Emerger Strategies, 2023). Meeting these compliance standards is essential not just for regulatory purposes but also for maintaining consumer trust and confidence in Walmart as a responsible retailer. Additionally, transparency in sustainability reporting becomes crucial for demonstrating accountability (Shenavar, 2023).

### Best Practices for Mitigation
As Walmart investigates options to mitigate environmental risks within their P2P processes, best practices from leading organizations can provide valuable insights. Strategies like implementing a comprehensive sustainable procurement policy, enhancing supplier evaluation practices, and developing transparent metrics for assessing sustainability can all contribute to reducing environmental risks (Supply Chain Dive, 2023). Moreover, adopting a circular economy model focused on waste reduction and reusability could further enhance Walmart's sustainability agenda (Walmart Corporate, 2023). Through the adaptation of advanced technologies, such as digital transformation and AI in inventory management, Walmart can streamline operations and reduce waste effectively.

### Conclusion
\hl{Walmart's Purchase-to-Pay process reveals numerous environmental risks stemming from its operational and supply chain dynamics.} Notably, through rigorous sustainability initiatives and best practices, Walmart has viable avenues to reduce these risks significantly. Through careful management of requisitioning, vendor selection, order creation, receipt of goods, payment processing, and supplier management, Walmart can strengthen its commitment to environmental sustainability while improving operational efficiency. \hl{The results derived from this analysis underline the necessity to incorporate sustainability as a fundamental aspect of business strategies in the P2P process.}
